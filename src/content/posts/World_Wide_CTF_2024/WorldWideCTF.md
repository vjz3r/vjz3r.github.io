# Bulletproof

![Bulletproof_chall_des_img](./img/Bulletproof.png)
[`‚¨áÔ∏èTransaction_Window_Line_System.jpg`](./img/Transaction_Window_Line_System.jpg)

## Solution

Looking at the corner of the image, we can see some details that are "a bit blurry," but clear enough to read:
![clue_from_img](./img/clue_from_img.png)
After that, search on Google, and with a bit of effort, we‚Äôll get the result:
![right_place](./img/right_place.png)
Go to Google Maps and just copy the address; you'll get the flag:
![flag1](./img/flag1.png)

### FLAG: ``wwf{3907s12thst_tacoma_wa98405_usa}``

# To the sky

![To_the_sky_chall_des_img](./img/to_the_sky.png)

## Solution

The person we need to look for is named "Elowen Vaelith." You'll easily find him on familiar platforms like:
>
> - [X(Twitter)](https://x.com/elowenvaelith)
> - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elowenvaelith)
> - [Github](https://github.com/elowenvaelith)

But I anticipated that, so I intentionally created an account on [``Tumblr``](https://www.tumblr.com/elowenvaelith). This platform is very well-known, but it might not be as popular among users like us (‚Äæ‚ó°‚óù)
![tumblr_account](./img/tumblr_account.png)
Visit his profile, and you'll immediately see a post with a riddle about airplanes:
![riddle](./img/riddle.png)
During the CTF, some people used AI chatbots to solve the riddle. I tried it before too, but it didn‚Äôt give the correct answer (maybe my chatbot was acting dumb )

The intended solution for this challenge is to use this website:
<https://www.aircraftrecognitionguide.com/identify-aircraft/identify-by-airplane-characteristics>

From the details in the post, use the filter to narrow it down to two civilian-use airplanes (click [**``HERE``**](./img/aircraftrecognitionguide-identify-aircraft-identify-by-airplane-characteristics.png) to see the full filter)

![preview](./img/preview_aircraftrecognitionguide-identify-aircraft-identify-by-airplane-characteristics.png)

So how do we figure out which one is correct? He mentioned that the plane he piloted is about 10 meters long. Try looking up the lengths of these two planes:
![plane_length](./img/aircraft_length.png)

# Identity

![identity_chall_des_img](./img/identity.png)

## Solution

Digging deeper into the accounts we've found, we'll discover an email address from his GitHub profile by adding `.patch` to the end of the commit URL.
<br>For example: <https://github.com/elowenvaelith/fuzzy-octo-garbanzo/commit/469247573c730141ec1848fa1d074c97b34c29eb.patch>

![email](./img/email_from_github.png)
So his email is: `th590668@gmail.com` <br>
Try sending him an email, and you‚Äôll receive an automatic reply email:
![auto_reply_email](./img/auto_reply_email.png)
There are plenty of resources analyzing PGP signatures; here‚Äôs one of them: <https://gaevoy.com/2019/05/10/pgp-signature.html><br>

Use this tool to decode the PGP: <https://cirw.in/gpg-decoder><br>
The [article](https://gaevoy.com/2019/05/10/pgp-signature.html) above provides a full analysis of the components in a PGP signature after decoding, but here, we only need to focus on the `KeyId`.
![decode](./img/keyid.png)
A quick explanation about KeyId: (from the [article](https://gaevoy.com/2019/05/10/pgp-signature.html))
![explain](./img/explain_keyid.png)
In our case, the **KeyId** is `e2792425ca477506`. By combining it with Keybase's API link, we get the complete URL:  
<https://keybase.io/_/api/1.0/key/fetch.json?ops=4&pgp_key_ids=e2792425ca477506><br>

Access the link, and you‚Äôll get his Keybase username: `orionjules`
![keybase_username](./img/username.png)
By accessing Keybase, we can get his real name:
![realname](./img/real_name.png)

### FLAG: ``wwf{orion_jules_stewart}``

<br>

# Memorial

![emorial_chall_des_img](./img/Memorial.png)

## Solution

Going back to Tumblr, we will see this post:
![sister_post_tumblr](./img/sister_post_tumblr.png)
He mentioned his family, and with a bit of reasoning we can follow the clues to uncover the family tree.
![fam_tree_web](./img/website_search.png)
Access the website and using the name we found in the previous challenge, we can find his family tree:
<https://gw.geneanet.org/th590668?n=stewart&p=orion+jules&type=tree>
![family_tree_search_result](./img/family_tree_search_result.png)
And here, we will also find out the favorite song of his sister: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFQzcY7YHc>
![fav_song](./img/flag4.png)
<iframe width="100%" height="468" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-uFQzcY7YHc?si=MosgkVWNhQpco9xI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### FLAG: ``wwf{head_in_the_clouds}``
